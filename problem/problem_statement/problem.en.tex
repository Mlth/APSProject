\section*{Input}
Input consists of three lines. The first line of input contains integers L, N where 0 $<$ L $\leq$ 10.000 is the length of the array and 0 $<$ N $\leq$ 10.000 is the number of operations. The second line of input consists of the integer sequence a\textsubscript{0}, a\textsubscript{1},..., a\textsubscript{L-1}. You can assume that -10.000 $\leq$ a\textsubscript{a} $\leq$ 10.000. Following the second line of input comes N operations that are written in one of two forms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Updates are of the form 'update i v', where \emph{i} is the index and \emph{v} is the value.
    \item Min-queries are of the form 'min s e' where \emph{s} is the start-index of the query and \emph{e} is the end-index of the query.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Output}
For every min-query, print out one integer: The minimum-value in the given range from \emph{s} to \emph{e}.
